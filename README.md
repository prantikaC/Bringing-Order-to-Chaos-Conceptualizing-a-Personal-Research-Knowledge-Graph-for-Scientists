## Abstract 
Research and work-related information is often manifold for a scientist, and the absence of an organizing
system may impede their research. Information that holds immense personal interest and importance to a
scientist may not be relevant to other users, yet it must be easily accessible to the scientist to enhance their
productivity. We aim to address the need for such a system with our proposal of a knowledge graph for
scientists, termed the Personal Research Knowledge Graph (PRKG). To identify the components of a PRKG,
we interview scientists at an academic institution for higher education and research regarding the issues that
the presence of a PRKG could solve. We translate the scientists’ requirements into separate KGs, collectively
known as the ‘Vitamins of PRKG’, and discuss methods for data acquisition to construct and maintain the
PRKG. A smart virtual agent is proposed as a medium of interaction between the user and the PRKG. We also
outline future research tracks, including those focused on maintaining the PRKG and protecting personal data
and privacy

## Acknowledgment
We would like to extend our acknowledgement and gratitude to the following scientists from the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, whose inputs helped us pin-point the constituents and utility of the PRKG:
